# Guardians of Purity üåä

This project was created by the group UCU-CODE-PDE with : 
- [React.js](https://react.dev/).
- [Bootstrap 5.3.3](https://getbootstrap.com/)
- [FontAwesome Icons library](https://fontawesome.com/icons) 
- [React-router-dom library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-router-dom)

## Info 
- Our team developed an educational game and a complementary website.
- The website explains the game rules and provides contextual information on water pollution, focusing on the impact of trash on aquatic ecosystems. 
- The game is based on the GLOBE (hydrosphere) protocol, where the character collects trash that falls into the water.
- It uses pH as a game mechanism: when the pH is not neutral, the player loses, symbolizing the loss of balance in ecosystems.
- The importance of this project lies in the need to educate new generations about water pollution and its effects on marine life and human health.
